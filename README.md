A collection of arduino-scripts that I use

# binaryClock
Fun side project - displays the time in binary through LEDs

# UART connect and read test:

The purpose is to demonstrate how to connect a serial to USB adapter and read the output

A script where the user is asked for a password and must input the right one to get the secret message
